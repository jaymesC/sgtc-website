            As a result of many churches on land today, you may find it
            difficult to identify which of the Churches around is the true
            gathering of God's children where a true worshipper can go and
            worship God in spirit and in truth, without being contaminated by
            man made doctrines and worldliness (John 4:24). Before now, you may
            not know the true church to go but if you are sincere and endure to
            read this tract to the end, you would know.
          </p>{" "}
          <br />
          <p>
            Frankly speaking, a man of character and honour seeks a decent lady
            for wife. I have never seen a decent man seeking for a prostitute to
            marry. Likewise, a man that is spiritual and wants to make heaven
            would seek for the most decent church to attend. And the most proper
            way of knowing the church of God is by their wholesome obedience to
            the word of God. For man was not created to live by bread alone but
            by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of God (Matt. 4:4).
          </p>{" "}
          <br />
          <p>
            However, a carnal Church member would not want to go to a place
            where the whole counsel of God is preached because he does not want
            the truth of the word of God. Instead, he prefers to belong to a
            graveyard congregation where the true word of God is distorted and
            misconstrued.
          </p>{" "}
          <br />
          <p>
            Such people always like to go to assemblies where their private
            lives will not be preached. The modern day Pentecostal Assemblies
            are typical example of this. Those that belong to them donate money
            in huge quantity to be seen, speak in tongues, prophesy, see vision,
            and still live in sin. They see themselves as Christians but still
            love the world and the things of the world. Lovers of pleasure more
            than lovers of God. The Bible says from such turn away (2 Tim
            3:4-9,1 John. 2:15-17).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            So, the choice you make today concerning a place of fellowship will
            either bring you closer to God and thus heavenly bound or send you
            to hell. <br />
            The natural Adam sought for a Bride that had the composition of his
            very bones and flesh but Christ being the second Adam sought for the
            word bride because He is the Word (John 1:1, 14, 18).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            That's why the truly converted Christians of a given age would live
            by the wholesome word of God for that age and be seen by God as the
            Bride of Christ but seen by men as fanatics. Carrying bible and
            belonging to a church denomination is not enough to accord you the
            honour of being a bride of Jesus Christ. Until when you are born
            again by the incorruptible word of God and filled with the Holy
            Ghost you are not yet a member of the true church of God in this end
            time. (1Cor. 12:13,1 Peter. 1:23).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The true church of God today are rare gem; and their type are not
            easily found. They watch over the word of God and hold it firm in
            love and great reverence (John. 14:15). She's the very opposite of
            the church denomination who are committing spiritual fornication
            with the world according to Rev.17.
            <br /> The true Church believes that God has no idle word in His
            Bible and that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is
            profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction and
            instructions in righteousness (2 Tim.3:16). Thus, the true church of
            God today believes in the following truths as expressed in the
            Bible.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>THE GOD HEAD</h3>
          <p>
            A true Bible believing church today will not preach or believe in
            TRINITY (I.e three distinct persons in one God). God was one in the
            old testament, as a result he cannot come to the new testament and
            now change to three gods.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            For our God is the unchanging God (Mal. 3:6, Heb. 13:8). The early
            church of the Lord Jesus Christ in the days of the apostles never
            propagated a three god in one doctrine. Instead they preached Jesus
            Christ to be the Lord God Almighty made manifest in flesh (1 Tim.
            3:16, John. 20 28, Col.2:9, Rev. 1:8).
          </p>
          <br />

            {" "}
            For our God is the unchanging God (Mal. 3:6, Heb. 13:8). The early

          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            Any congregation believing and preaching any other God beside the
            Lord Jesus Christ are idolaters and false prophets. God is ONE and
            His name is The Lord Jesus Christ and in Him dwelleth eternal life
            and not in another (1 John. 5:20-21, John. 5:43, Acts 4:12, John.
            1:18,1 John. 4:1-3).
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>WATER BAPTISM</h3>
          <p>
            The correct way of Christian Baptism has been revealed in this age.
            That's why the true church is referred to in the Bible as the wife
            of the Lord Jesus Christ (Eph.5: 23-24). And as a wife, she's not
            ashamed to identity with the name of her husband in water baptism as
            it was in the days of the apostles of old (Acts. 2:38,Acts. 10:48).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Now, if you are in a false gathering that baptised you when you were
            a small child and have not even known the difference between right
            or wrong you need to be re-baptised by immersion in water in the
            name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, if you have been baptised by immersion in water unto
            titles of Father, Son and Holy Ghost and not unto the name of the
            Lord Jesus Christ, you need to be re-baptised correctly according to
            the Bible (Acts. 19:1-6, Col. 3:17). Father, Son and Holy Ghost are
            titles and not name, that's why in Matt. 28:19 Christ commanded his
            disciples to go and baptise unto a (singular name) that holds the
            three titles of Father, Son and Holy Ghost. And the name of the
            Father, Son and Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ (John. 14:9,
            Jhn. 9:35-37, 2Cor. 3: 6-17, Jhn. 5:43, Jhn. 17:26
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            This is the revelation the disciples of Jesus Christ had and
            baptised all their converts in water in the name of the Lord Jesus
            Christ (Acts. 8:16, Gal. 3:27, Rom. 6:3-4). Therefore, if you are a
            true disciple of Jesus Christ like Peter, Paul and the rest of them
            were; you will certainly honour and do what they did in the bible by
            the Holy Ghost. Be it known likewise that there is no way you can
            deny any of the teachings of the apostles of Jesus Christ if you
            have the Holy Ghost (Jhn. 17:20,1 Jhn. 4:6, Eph. 2:20). Instead you
            will cherish apostolic doctrines, believe them and live the life of
            a true Christian. (Jhn. 16:7,13)
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>WOMAN PREACHER</h3>
          <p>
            {" "}
            A Bible believing church would not allow a woman pastor or a woman
            teacher in the church, because it is an act of disobedience to the
            word of God. There was never a woman priest in the old testament,
            likewise no woman apostle or teacher in the new testament Apostolic
            movement (1Tim 2:9-15, I Cor.14:34-38).You may have a good reason
            for allowing a woman pastor or teacher in your church but the Bible
            reason must prevail over your own reason (Rom. 3:4). The reason God
            gave for disallowing a Woman from being a preacher is that she was
            the one that was deceived in the Garden of Eden and not Adam, as a
            result she has to keep silent as far as preaching the word of God is
            concerned in all the Churches of the Saints (1 Tim. 2:12-14)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            Notwithstanding, a woman in the body of Christ can pray, Prophesy,
            testify, sing song and operate any of the nine(9) gifts of the Holy
            Ghost in the church (1 Cor. 12:8-11) but not to lead men in any
            capacity of the five fold ministry of Eph. 4:8-11 for whatever
            reason.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>HAIR COVERING</h3>
          <p>
            {" "}
            The long hair of a woman is given to her by God for the covering of
            her head and not scarf. That's why a woman that cuts off the hair of
            her head has cut off her God given covering and glory, Thus in this
            condition it's not proper for her to approach God in prayer (1cor.
            11:5, 13, 15). Also, a woman with low cut has succeeded in making
            herself equal with man which is against the law of God that made the
            man the head of the woman. (Eph.5:23,1 Cor. 11:3).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            Therefore, any woman that cuts of her long hair and then use scarf
            to cover it when she wants to pray 'is uncovered still before God
            Since the long hair of a woman is her head covering and not any man
            made substitute emanating from false teachings of the tradition of
            men (I Cor.11:15-16, Mk. 7:7-8).
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>SPEAKING IN TONGUES</h3>
          <p>
            {" "}
            Many churches today have made speaking in tongues the initial
            evidence of the Holy Ghost. This view emanates from a total
            disregard to the Word of God because Apostle Paul in the Bible says
            we as children of God do not all speak in tongues (1 Cor.12:30).
            However, in our modem day Pentecostal churches we see almost
            everybody trying to speak in a worked-up tongues Which even in most
            cases the speaker does not live or dress like a Christian.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            This kind of confusion cannot happen in the true church of God for
            they know the truth and the truth have set them free from error
            (John.8:32). The true church believes that speaking in tongues is
            one of the gifts of the Holy Ghost but not the initial evidence of
            the baptism of the Holy Ghost. For it is possible that an
            unrepentant Church member that is still living in sin would speak in
            tongues and See visions since gifts and calling of God are without
            repentance (Rom. 11:29, Psm. 68:18). That's why there's a difference
            between having a gift of the Holy Ghost and having the giver of the
            gift actually dwelling in you. To this the Bible says anyone without
            the Spirit of Christ is non of his (Rom. 8:9).
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>ABOMINABLE PRACTICES IN CHURCHES</h3>
          <p>
            {" "}
            1. Preachers of these modern days Pentecostal churches do allow
            women to wear trousers and would close their eyes to it. Knowing
            that a woman that puts on a garment that partaineth unto men is an
            abomination to God (Deut. 22:5). What a shame! They have forgotten
            that Christianity is more than a mere religious or social gathering,
            but it is living a correct life of truth by the spirit of God.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            2. Modern Churches and false old ones today organize harvest, bazaar
            and introduce unscriptural means to raise funds. They make their
            leaders the ultimate in everything they do instead of Christ. That's
            why their church members would not care to compare their doctrines
            with the bible, but instead they are prepared to compare their
            belief with what their leaders say whether right or wrong, Biblical
            or not biblical (Matt 15:14)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            3. The false churches on land today have drifted away from
            fundamental principles of the bible. They mix strange things with
            the worship of our Lord Jesus Christ, like burning of candles and
            incense, drinking of the so-called holy water and through the
            practice of divination see vision. You had better come out from
            among them now and touch non of their unclean things or else the
            judgement of God would fall on you soon (2 Cor. 6:17-18)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            4. The Roman Catholic Church would tell you that there is a place
            called purgatory after death. What a deception! if you want to
            escape the judgement of God after death you had better purge your
            soul now by the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ, else when you die a
            sinner, you will face the judgement of God and be condemned to hell
            (the lake of fire), for there is no repentance in the grave and
            nothing like purgatory in the entire Bible (Heb.9:27, Eccl. 9:5,
            Rev. 20:14-15).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            5. Church denominations of these days train their preachers in Bible
            Schools and Seminaries that are established and organized by men.
            What an abomination! God' true ministers are trained by the Holy
            Ghost all over the world and not by man made programmes and ideas
            (Acts. 1:8, Gal 1:11-12). What unlearned men like Peter and John
            spoke that's what they go to learn in seminary and after coming out
            they do contrary to what these men of God taught under the influence
            of the Holy Ghost. Oh! What a blind generation of Preachers!
            Children of God, run for your dear lives before it's too late (Acts.
            4:13, Gal. 1:11-12. I Cor. 1:26-29, Acts 19:1-6, Gal. 1:8, Col. 2:8)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            6. Today, we see church members go to Cinema houses, they go there
            to watch blue films, play cards, read ungodly magazines that display
            the nakedness of women. Yet, nothing condemns them from doing all
            these things of the world. Remember, the type of books you read,
            places you go, things you watch, and things you wear, identify the
            type of spirit that is dwelling in you. For if the spirit that is
            dwelling in you is the Holy Spirit, you will go to the right places,
            read godly books and live the right kind of life to the Glory of
            God. (1 Jhn. 2:15, 1Cor. 31)
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            {" "}
            Dear reader, at this point you should know that it is a
            misconception that a true church of God is one that has a large
            congregations and well-known in towns while others with few members
            are referred to as mushroom churches. The truth is that God is not
            known by large congregation because truth is bitter. In the days of
            Noah (8) people were saved. After departure of our lord Jesus Christ
            from This world he had only 120 people that waited to receive the
            Holy Ghost in the upper room.

            Today, the true church of God is still in the minority as it was in
            days gone by (Lk. 17:26-30). Be one of the few members of the body
            of Christ today that have been made ready for the rapture by the
            full word of God (Eph. 5:26-27, Rev. 19:7). The true church of God
            is not prepared to compromise the word of God for a morsel of
            porridge like Esau did. Riches, fame, and -worldly comforts may go;
            they won't care. Their whole life is centered on the written word of
            God from Genesis to Revelation (Matt. 4:4).

            I therefore conclude by persuading you to take heed to the voice of
            the spirit in these last days according to the Biblical teachings of
            this tract. Take a bold step now and come out of these man-made
            denominational systems that call them selves churches and are
            teaching contrary to the written word of God. Come to the address
            below and be baptised in water by immersion in the name of the Lord
            Jesus Christ and thou shall be filled with the Holy Ghost (Acts.
            2:38, Acts. 19:1-6. Col.3:17, Acts. 16:30-33).

            Any congregation believing and preaching any other God beside the
            Lord Jesus Christ are idolaters and false prophets. God is ONE and
            His name is The Lord Jesus Christ and in Him dwelleth eternal life
            and not in another (1 John. 5:20-21, John. 5:43, Acts 4:12, John.
            1:18,1 John. 4:1-3).
